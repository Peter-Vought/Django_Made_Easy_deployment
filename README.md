<h1>Django_Made_Easy_deployment ðŸš€</h1>

<p>
  The deployment process might get tricky, and opportunities for error are easy to find. The
  following chapter serves as a step-by-step deployment guide and is based on
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> documents 
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04">Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 20.04</a> and
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-20-04">How To Set Up
  Django with Postgres, Nginx, and Gunicorn on Ubuntu 20.04</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We will start by setting up our Virtual Private Server along with the PostgreSQL database
  and virtual environment. We will configure the <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> application server to interface
  with our applications and set up <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> to reverse proxy to Gunicorn, giving us access to
  its security and performance features to serve our apps. As a final step, we will go through
  custom domain setup and adding an SSL certificate to our website.
</p>

<h2>VPS access and security</h2>

<p>
  We will use the DigitalOcean cloud hosting provider to house our project. If you havenâ€™t
  created your account yet, you can use this <a href="https://m.do.co/c/36d391016ef7">link</a> to register and get free $100 credit to start.

<h3>Creating Droplet</h3>

<p>
  Once registered and signed in, select Droplets from the dropdown menu. We are then redirected to the Droplet creation page. 
  Droplets are basically instances of various Linux distributions. 
  Select Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) version and Basic plan. We will opt for a $5/month plan, which is more than enough for our needs. 
  We wonâ€™t be adding any additional storage, so ignore the Add block storage option. For
  the datacenter region, select the one closest to you. As for Authentication, we will be using SSH keys to set up and secure our connection to
  the server.
<p>

<h3>Creating SSH key</h3>

<p>
  We donâ€™t have any SSH keys available as of now. Letâ€™s go ahead and create one. In case
  you are running Windows, the ssh key creation process might be slightly different to
  macOS/Linux. If unsure, follow this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">guide</a>. 
  For macOS and Linux, open your terminal and type the following command:<br><br>
  <strong><i>terminal</i></strong><br>
  ~$ ssh-keygen<br><br>
  By default, we will be offered to create id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files. I prefer to keep my ssh
  keys separated, so I will specify a different name for these files:<br><br>
  <strong><i>terminal</i></strong><br>
  Generating public/private rsa key pair.
  Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/peter/.ssh/id_rsa): <strong>.ssh/id_rsa_do</strong><br><br>
  And following private and public ssh keys are generated for me:<br><br>
  ~/.ssh/id_rsa_do
  ~/.ssh/id_rsa_do.pub<br><br>
  Letâ€™s copy the contents of the id_rsa.pub key by using the following command:<br><br>
  <strong><i>terminal</i></strong><br>
  ~$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_do.pub<br><br>
  This command will reveal the content of our public ssh key file in the terminal. Return
  back to DigitalOcean, click on New SSH Key, and paste the content to the SSH key window.
  Provide some name for this key. Once done with these steps, click on Add SSH Key to add a new SSH key to our account.
  Letâ€™s finish this setup by creating our Droplet by clicking on the Create Droplet button
  down below.
</p>

<h3>Logging into Droplet</h3>

<p>
  Letâ€™s try connecting to our Droplet. Open terminal and type the following command
  (replace <i>104.131.185.203</i> with your IP address):<br></br>
  <strong><i>terminal</i></strong><br>
  ~$ ssh root@104.131.185.203<br></br>
  When logging in for the first time, you will most probably receive the following
  notification:<br><br>
  <strong><i>terminal</i></strong><br>
  The authenticity of host '104.131.185.203 (104.131.185.203)' can't be established.<br>
  ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:B8ePWNEy7jjmhamtQkHi1w6HsumydXKxftmrWD4ufj8.<br>
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? Yes<br><br>
  You might also receive the following message:<br><br>
  <strong><i>terminal</i></strong><br>
  root@ 104.131.185.203: Permission denied(publickey)<br><br>
  In this case, run the following command to add the key to ssh-agent:<br><br>
  <strong><i>terminal</i></strong><br>
  ~$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_do<br><br>
  and try to connect again:<br><br>
  <strong><i>terminal</i></strong><br>
  ~$ ssh root@104.131.185.203<br><br>
  Upon successfully logging into our server, we are greeted by the following report:<br><br>
  <strong><i>Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS terminal</i></strong><br>
